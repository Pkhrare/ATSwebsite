// projectTemplates.js

/**
 * This file contains the static data for project templates.
 * 
 * HOW TO ADD A NEW TEMPLATE:
 * 1. Copy the entire `dummyProject` object and paste it as a new element in the `projectTemplates` array.
 * 2. Change the `id` to a new unique string (e.g., 'template-2').
 * 3. Update the `name` and `description` to reflect the new template.
 * 4. Modify the `projectData` object with the desired default values for the new project.
 * 5. Add or remove task groups in the `taskGroups` array.
 * 6. Add or remove tasks in the `tasks` array. Make sure the `groupId` for each task
 *    matches the `id` of a group in the `taskGroups` array if you want it to be grouped.
 *    If a task should be ungrouped, set its `groupId` to null.
 * 7. Task `id` fields should be unique within the template, but they are temporary. New IDs
 *    will be generated when the project is actually created.
 * 8. To pre-attach a form to a task, add the `preAttachedFormName` property to its `fields` object
 *    with the exact name of the form as the value. The component will fetch and attach it on load.
